# iOS, Xcode 8, & Swift

This markdown was created as a quickstart and reference guide to getting up and productive with iOS, Xcode, and Swift.



### ViewController

When you add a Button or another object to the interface, you also need to add it to the code.

- Click the `ViewController.swift` and click the "Assistant Editor" button that looks like 2 circles. 
- Hold `control` and click the object to drag it into the `ViewController` code.

When you change the name of an `IBOutlet` the app will crash. It has to be removed from the interface builder "OUTLETS" section. 

Go to your Main storyboard from the far left menu > right-click the ViewController in the submenu > and look for any yellow triangle warnings.
