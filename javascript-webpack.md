# Webpack

## What is webpack?

Webpack is a code bundler. It takes the files in your code, transforms them, and gives you a new version of your code that can be interpreted by the browser.

SASS/LESS => CSS

CoffeeScript => JavaScript.

Webpack just needs to know..
- where your application starts *(Usually index.js or your root JS file.)*
- what transformations need to be done to your code
- where your bundle gets created to display to the browser
