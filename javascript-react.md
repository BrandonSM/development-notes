# REACT NOTES

This is a collection of my notes I'm keeping for various programming languages as I learn them. I will try and include sources as I use them as well. It's inteded for use as quick notes to remind me what certain things do, what the concepts/ideas of each section are, and maybe some example code usage.

If you find it useful, star it and enjoy it.

## 1. APP SETUP

FOLDER STRUCTURE -- You can use the "create-react-app" package as a boilerplate. The great mind of Dan Abramov (facebook) decided to give us a pre-built "app" template to cut down on development time. (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

"node_modules" - where npm modules are installed on the project (if not global)

"src" - folder where application source code goes. 

"public" - folder where the public facing part of the site goes. Like your HTML and image files.

"package.json" - holds the npm dependencies and specifies app properties. This includes app information, build scripts, and npm packages.

"README.md" - standard markdown file that is included with every project. the "create-react-app" specific readme has links to various resources and documentation.

"yarn.lock" - yarn lock file.



```Javascript
USAGE: npm install create-react-app
```

## 2. Props

Props are equivalent to arguments (args)

eg....

```Javascript
const HelloWorld = (props) => { }
```
